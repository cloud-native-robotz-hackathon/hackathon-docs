== Introduction

During preparation and execution of a robot hackathon two roles are needed: 

Organizers and Facilitators. Organizers task is to take care of logistices, location, pre-requirements. Facilitators have in-depth knowledge of the setup and will run the actual hackathon. 

The Robot Hackathon attendees are organized in teams. Each team will get a robot and team size can be 2-3 members. The maximum number of teams depends on a number of factors but experience shows two facilitators should be able to handle up to 10 teams.



Having the pre-requisites outlined in this document in preparation for the Hackathon is important for the success. Please check back with the facilitators ahead of time to clarify open topics.



=== Infrastructure

Most of the components needed for the Hackathon run on a cloud-based OpenShift cluster *provided by the facilitators* . Only a stable Internet connection between the robots and the cloud-based Openshift Container Platform is needed. 

Connectivity from the robots to the OpenShift cluster is established through a WIFI router *provided by the facilitators* . 

This router can either be bridged to the local WIFI or, if not possible, to a mobile hotspot. If possible the local Wifi that the router connects to, should be separate of the attendee WIFI. Having a stable and reliable WIFI/Internet connection is a crucial part of the preparations! It should be checked well in advance.

== Attendees and Teams 



* *Attendees*
  ** One laptop for each attendee (or at least per team, see below)
  ** Usually this means BYOL
  ** Laptop requirements: Browser (Chrome/Firefox, Internet-connection) 
  ** Should have some programming experience
* *Teaming*
  ** At least one laptop per team
  ** If possible each team should have at least one experienced developer.
  ** Teams get pre-assigned names
  ** Team division should be done pre-event to distribute differently skilled attendees
* *Registration*
  ** Have attendees register pre-event
  ** Query for level of experience/programming languages
  ** Walk-Ins should be avoided and then only to join existing teams 
  ** If you are planning to take pictures or videos make sure you have the attendees sign GDPR release forms

== Location, Room and Space



The following two locations can be in two separate or a single room depending on availability.



*Meeting Location for all attendees*

* Equipment
  ** Standard equipment (Seating, projector, flipchart)
* Activities
  ** Registration
  ** Dividing attendees into teams according to planning
  ** Handing out team badges
  ** Initial presentation and briefing

*Robot Hackathon Location*

* Equipment
  ** Table/seating per team with team name
  ** Enough power outlets per table (laptops/robot)
  ** Space for test runs of the robot
  ** A test labyrinth from the cardboard boxes provided for each team or shared between teams 
  ** Space for a separate final test labyrinth
  ** A labyrinth usually needs an area of 2 x 2 meters 
* Activities
  ** Having funâ€¦ the actual hackathon
  ** Robot hacking & Testing
  ** Final presentation/testing of solutions

== Agenda/Time Planning



Meeting Location (1 Hour)

Hackathon Area

* Teams go through guided steps (self-paced, ~1 hour)
* Hacking (~3 hours, fixed duration)
* Teams present solution in final labyrinth

== Description for Invitation



Container-based development is all the rage and you really want to know

what OpenShift as a container platform can do for you? And having some

fun along the way isn't bad, either?



Then join us for this hackathon. You'll learn a lot about cloud-native Development on OpenShift  while writing code to steer a robot through a maze. The robot is controlled through API calls, exposed through our API management platform 3Scale. The coding won't be too complex, you can send directional commands or query a distance sensor. You'll leverage a browser based IDE and the runtime of your choice.



It's all about getting the little guy through a labyrinth safely and to get an idea of how easy coding can be when everything else is taken care of by the platform.



For this lab you should have at least some basic coding experience. An introduction and code templates (Java/Python/PHP/NodeJS) to get you started will be provided.
